In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations.

$$ \mathbf{x}'(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t) $$

$$ \mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t) $$

At time $t$, we have the following:

- $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the input vector
- $y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^q$ is the output vector
- $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector. This represents the system's **time-dependent internal state**.
- Matrices $A, B, C, D$ don't depend on time. These represent the system's **time-independent** parameters.
- $x'(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as the derivative of the state vector $x(t)$. It captures the change in the state vector over time.

[Idea/Doubt?] The state-space representation models the differential relationships explicitly unlike other models like transformer.
This could be a reason why it's better for signal data.

#### Physical Example

Considering a classical ["Moving object example"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation#Moving_object_example), an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring.

We want to model the object's position given a force.

- The applied force over time is the input vector $u(t)$.
- The object's position over time is the output vector $y(t)$.

The **time-independent** parameters are

- $b$ the viscous fiction coefficient
- $k$ the spring constant
- $m$ the mass of the object.

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -k/m & -b/m \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1/m \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

The **time-dependent** internal states are

- $\mathbf{x}_2(t) = \mathbf{x}'_1(t)$ the velocity of the object
- $\mathbf{x}'_2(t) = \mathbf{x}''_1(t)$ the acceleration of the object
- $\mathbf{x}_1(t) = y(t)$ The position of the object.

#### Dropping the D matrix

The D matrix presents the direct feedthrough from the input to the output. It's often zero.
Even if it is not zero, this can be replaced by standard skip connections in the neural network.

$$ \mathbf{x}'(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t) $$

$$ \mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) $$

### Addressing Long-Range Dependencies with HiPPO

The basic State Space Model performs very poorly in practice, because it may suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.
