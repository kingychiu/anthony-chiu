The notes I wrote here are mostly based on the readings below.
Under development...

In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations.

At time $t$ (continuous/discrete), we have the following vectors:

- $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the input vector
- $y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^q$ is the output vector
- $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector. This represents the system's **time-dependent internal state**.
- Matrices $A, B, C, D$ don't depend on time. These represent the system's **time-independent** parameters.
- $x'(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as the derivative of the state vector $x(t)$. It captures the change in the state vector over time.

(My Guessing (?)) The state space model enforces/guides the hidden states towards differential relationships between the input and output vectors. This is one reason
why state space models might be better than transformers for long time series data.

**Example**

Considering a classical ["Moving object example"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation#Moving_object_example), an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring.

We want to model the object's position given a force.

- The applied force over time is the input vector $u(t)$.
- The object's position over time is the output vector $y(t)$.

The **time-independent** parameters are

- $b$ the viscous fiction coefficient
- $k$ the spring constant
- $m$ the mass of the object.

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -k/m & -b/m \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1/m \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

The **time-dependent** internal states are

- $\mathbf{x}_2(t) = \mathbf{x}'_1(t)$ the velocity of the object
- $\mathbf{x}'_2(t) = \mathbf{x}''_1(t)$ the acceleration of the object
- $\mathbf{x}_1(t) = y(t)$ The position of the object.
