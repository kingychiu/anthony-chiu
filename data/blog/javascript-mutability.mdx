## Overview

In this article, I am trying my best to explain JavaScript `Mutability` **without** touching the concept of `Memory Allocation`.
Although `Memory Allocation` is very important, but it doesn't make sense
to have it as a hard requirement to learn a high-level language like JavaScript.

Most of the contents here are copied from the other websites.
The objective of this post is to give code examples and
visualization to these fundamental yet confusing topics.

## Primitive Type and Object Class

A primitive type value cannot be mutated (immutable), while a JavaScript Object is mutable.

> There are 7 primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `null`.
> **All primitives are `immutable`**, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value.

Quoted from [Primitive - MDN Web Docs Glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)

> `Mutable` is a type of variable **that can be changed**.
> In JavaScript, **only objects and arrays are mutable**, not primitive values.

Quoted from [Mutable - MDN Web Docs Glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mutable)

Now we have a brief idea of which JS types are mutable which aren't.
But what actually are JavaScript Objects?

> The `Object` class represents one of JavaScript's data types. **Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of `Object`**

Quoted from [Object - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

Alright, so basically if we are not doing something advance, apart from the values of the above 7 primitive types,
all other stuffs are instances of `Object` class and therefore they are `mutable`.

### What are instances of the `Object` class?

To better understand what are an instance of `Object` class, we can demonstrate this concept with
[instanceof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof).

> The instanceof operator tests to see if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value.

Firstly let's take a look if a primitive type is an instance of `Object` class, if we run the following code,
we will find the 1 as a `number` is not an instance of the `Object` class.

```JavaScript
const a = 1
console.log("a:", a) // -> 1
console.log(
  "a instanceof Object:",
  a instanceof Object,
) // -> false
```

Next we can see an `array` is an instance of `Object` class:

```JavaScript
c = [1, 2, 3]
console.log("c:", c) // -> [1, 2, 3]
console.log(
  "c instanceof Object:",
  c instanceof Object,
) // -> true
console.log("c[0]:", c[0]) // -> 1
console.log(
  "c[0] b instanceof Object:",
  c[0] instanceof Object,
) // -> false
```

This also applies to an `array of arrays`. The `arrays` inside an `array` are also instances of `Object` class:

```JavaScript
e = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
console.log("e:", e) // -> [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
console.log(
  "e instanceof Object:",
  e instanceof Object,
) // -> true
console.log("e[0]:", e[0]) // -> [1, 2, 3]
console.log(
  "e[0] instanceof Object:",
  e[0] instanceof Object,
) // -> true
console.log("e[0][0]:", e[0][0]) // -> 1
console.log(
  "e[0][0] instanceof Object",
  e[0][0] instanceof Object,
) // -> false
```

## Stack Frame Diagram

I would only continue our discussion in terms of `Stack Frame Diagrams` to avoid touching the details of JavaScript `Memory Allocation`.
Stack Frame Diagram is an `abstraction` for describing a programing language runtime memory behavior;
the actual memory allocation might be different from Stack Frame Diagram. This is very important as we are not discussing at the level of
`JavaScript engine` or `Operating System`. If you are really interested into the implementations this is a great discussion thread:
[JavaScript, Ruby and C are not call by reference](https://dev.to/xpbytes/javascript-ruby-and-c-are-not-call-by-reference-23f7)

The Stack Frame Diagram visualizer I am using fow the remaining discussion is https://pythontutor.com/

## What are References?

References are the internals of a language, different languages have different implementations.
Again a very good explanation here if you are interested: (For JavaScript)

> A reference type doesn't store its value directly.
> Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.

Quoted from [JavaScript, Ruby and C are not call by reference](https://dev.to/xpbytes/javascript-ruby-and-c-are-not-call-by-reference-23f7)

## Primitive Type and Object Class in Stack Frame Diagram

<div>
  <img
    alt="primitive-type-and-object-stack-frame"
    src="/static/images/javascript-Mutability/primitive-type-and-object-sf.png"
    style={{ background: 'white', maxHeight: '300px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
</div>

In the above visualization, we can see `a` and `b` are stored in a frame called `Global`,
while only the references of `c` and `d` are stored at the `Global` frame. The actual values contained in `c` and `d` are
stored elsewhere.

## Reassigning Value to a Variable

<div>
  <img
    alt="reassigning-primitive-type-stack-frame"
    src="/static/images/javascript-Mutability/reassigning-primitive-type-sf.png"
    style={{ background: 'white', maxHeight: '300px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
</div>

Now, if we re-assign `a` and `b`, we can see the values under the `Global` frame are updated.

<div>
  <img
    alt="reassigning-object-stack-frame"
    src="/static/images/javascript-Mutability/reassigning-object-sf.png"
    style={{ background: 'white', maxHeight: '400px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
</div>

If we re-assign `c` and `d` with another values, we can see the original `[1, 2, 3]`
and `{k1: "v1", k2: "v2"}` are gone.

## Assigning a Variable's Value to Another Variable

<div>
  <img
    alt="assign-a-variable-value-to-another-stack-frame"
    src="/static/images/javascript-Mutability/assign-a-variable-value-to-another-sf.png"
    style={{ background: 'white', maxHeight: '400px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
</div>

Now, we declare new variables (`e`, `f`, `h`, `i`) and assigning
the values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to them.
From the visualization we can see `e` and `f` got new copies of the values from `a` and `b`, while
`h` and `i` store the references that referencing the same values referenced by `c` and `d`.
