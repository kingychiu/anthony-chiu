## Sample Space and Event of a Random Experiment

A `Random Experiment` is a process with uncertain outcomes. A set of all the possible
outcomes of the random experiment is called the `Sample Space` $\Omega$.

- If rolling one dice is the random experiment, the sample space $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

A `Random Variable` is a function that takes a sample space and maps it to a new sample space:

- The easiest one is the identical (1-to-1) function, let the `Random Variable` $X$ be the outcomes (the sample space) of rolling one dice (the random experiment).
  $X$ takes values $\Omega_{X} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, as well.

A `Event` is a subset of a sample space $\Omega$:

- $(X=2)$ describes an `Event` subset $\Omega_{X=2}=\{2\}$, and it describes we got a value $2$ from the random experiment of rolling one dice.
- $(X=\mathbf{Odd})$ describes an `Event` subset $\Omega_{X=\mathbf{Odd}}=\{1, 3, 5\}$, and it describes we got a odd number value from the random experiment of rolling one dice.

A `Composed Experiment` describes the repetitions of the same random experiment, and each repetition can be called a `trail`.

## Probability and Probability Distribution

Let's consider a random variable $X$ with $M$ discrete outcomes $\Omega_{X}=\{x_1, x_2,..., x_i, ... x_M\}$.

$P(X=x_i)$ denotes the `probability` of an event of $X$ being $x_i$. For example,
if $X$ is the smartphone model we found in a random experiment, $P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE})$ is the probability of finding
an IPhoneSE smartphone in the random experiment.

Taking all outcomes into account, $P(X)$ denotes the `probability distribution` of $X$:

- Probability Mass Function (Histogram) for discrete outcomes.
- Probability Density Function for continuous outcomes.

## Joint Probability

Let's say there are two random variables $(X, Y)$ in a random experiment.

- $X$ has M outcomes $\Omega_{X} =\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_i, ..., x_M\}$.
- $Y$ has L outcomes $\Omega_{Y} =\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_j, ..., y_L\}$.

Then each observation in the random experiment is a pair of events $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$. $P(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ denotes the `joint probability` of two events, $(X=x_i)$ and $(Y=y_j)$, occurring at the same time.

For example, if $X$ and $Y$ are the smartphone model and the gender we
found in an random experiment, respectively, $P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE}, Y=\mathbf{Male})$ indicates the probability of finding a male with IPhone SE in the random experiment.

After obtaining the joint probability of each $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ pair, we can get the `joint probability distribution` $P(X, Y)$.
To illustrate this idea, the following code generates 1000 $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ pairs (`xs` and `ys`):

```python
# Take 1000 samples between [1, 5)
xs = [np.random.randint(1, 5) for _ in range(1000)]
# Take 1000 samples between [1, 3)
ys = [np.random.randint(1, 3) for _ in range(1000)]
# Count the (x, y) pairs and convert them to a dataframe
joint_dist_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(Counter(zip(xs, ys)), orient="index").reset_index()
joint_dist_df.columns = ["Event", "P(X, Y)"]
joint_dist_df["X"] = [e[0] for e in joint_dist_df["Event"]]
joint_dist_df["Y"] = [e[1] for e in joint_dist_df["Event"]]
# Compute the joint probability
joint_dist_df["P(X, Y)"] /= joint_dist_df["P(X, Y)"].sum()
joint_dist_df
```

The above code generates the following dataframe:

<div>
  <img
    alt="Joint Probability Distribution"
    src="/static/images/probability-theory/joint-probs.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
  <div className="text-center">Joint Probability Distribution $P(X,Y)$</div>
</div>

## Marginal Probability

Based on the observations of $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ we can calculate the `marginal probability` $P(X=x_i)$ by
marginalizing $Y$:

$$
P(X=x_i) = \sum_{j} P(X=x_i, Y=y_j)
$$

For example, if $X$ and $Y$ are the smartphone model and the gender we
found in a random experiment, respectively. We can compute $P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE})$ by adding up the corresponding joint
probabilites for each gender.

$$
P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE}) = P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE}, Y=\mathbf{Male}) + P(X=\mathbf{IPhoneSE},
Y=\mathbf{Female})
$$

Applying this to all $X$'s outcomes we get the `marginal probability distribution` $P(X)$:

$$
P(X) = \sum_{Y} P(X, Y)
$$

This is called the `sum rule of probability theory`.
The following code shows how to compute the marginal probability distribution:

```python
marginal_x_dist_df = joint_dist_df.groupby("X")["P(X, Y)"].sum().reset_index()
marginal_x_dist_df.columns = ["X", "P(X)"]
marginal_x_dist_df
```

The above code generates the following dataframe:

<div>
  <img
    alt="Marginal Probability Distribution"
    src="/static/images/probability-theory/marginal-probs.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
  <div className="text-center">Marginal Probability Distribution $P(X)$</div>
</div>

## Conditional Probability

If we filter the observations by a particular outcome (e.g., $X=x_i$), we can calculate the probabilities of
observing $Y=y_j$ given the filtered observations $(X=x_i)$. It is called the `conditional probability` $P(Y=y_j|X=x_i)$

The following code shows how to compute the `conditional probability distribution` $P(Y|X)$:

```python
for x_i in range(1, 5):
    print("For x_i =", x_i)
    # Filter obseravtions based on x_i
    _df = joint_dist_df[joint_dist_df["X"]==x_i].copy()
    _df = pd.merge(_df, marginal_x_dist_df, how="left", on="X")
    # Calculate the conditional probabilites
    _sum = _df["P(X, Y)"].sum()
    _df["P(Y|X)"] = _df["P(X, Y)"] / _sum
    display(_df)
```

The above code generates the following dataframe:

<div>
  <img
    alt="Conditional Probability Distribution"
    src="/static/images/probability-theory/conditional-probs.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: '700px', margin: 'auto' }}
  />
  <div className="text-center">Conditional Probability Distribution $P(Y|X)$</div>
</div>

From the result we can also observe that the conditional probability $P(Y=y_j|X=x_j)$ can be calculated with:

$$
P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) = \frac{P(X = x_i, Y = y_j)}
{P(X = x_i)}
$$

And the conditional probability distribution can be written as:

$$
P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X, Y)}
{P(X)}
$$

And, $P(X,Y)=P(Y|X)P(X)$ is called the `product rule of probability theory`.

## Independence

There is a special case for the `product rule` above. If two events $X=x_i$ and $Y=y_j$ are independent, Knowing $X=x_i$ in advance won't change the
probability of having $Y=y_j$; therefore:

- The conditional probability becomes $P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) = P(Y=y_j)$
- The conditional probability distribution becomes $P(Y|X) = P(Y)$

Applying this new information to the `product rule` above we will get:

$$
P(X, Y) = P(X) \times P(Y)
$$

if $X=x_i$ and $Y=y_j$ are independent.

## Test of Independence

```python
# Take 1000 samples between [1, 5)
xs = [np.random.randint(1, 5) for _ in range(1000)]
# Take 1000 samples between [1, 3)
ys = [np.random.randint(1, 3) for _ in range(1000)]
```

In the Python coding example, we generated 1000 $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ pairs (`xs` and `ys`) uniformly and independently. But why we are not
getting a perfect result of $P(X, Y) = P(X) \times P(Y)$?

Let's find out the reason by looking at the marginal probabilities $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$. Ideally we should see $P(X=x_i)=0.25$ and $P(Y=y_j)=0.5$ from the code output, but
it is not the case. Actually, if we increase the sample size, $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ will get closer to the ideal values.

So there is a problem with counting observations: the probabilities obtained from counting observations are not entirely accurate.

We can also use the Chi-squared test to test if two categorical values are independent. Chi-squared test tests if two categorical variables are dependent on each other or not.

- The null hypothesis: $(X=x_i)$ and $(Y=y_j)$ are independent.
- The alternative hypothesis: $(X=x_i)$ and $(Y=y_j)$ are dependent.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2
# The null hypothesis is that they are independent.
# P <= 0.05: Reject the null hypothesis.
# P > 0.05: Accept the null hypothesis.
chi2(np.array(xs).reshape(-1, 1), np.array(ys).reshape(-1, 1))
# > (array([0.88852322]), array([0.34587782]))
```

The test returns a P-value of 0.346; therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that $(X=x_i)$ and $(Y=y_j)$ are independent.

## Frequentist Probability and Bayesian Probability

The entire discussion above is based on counting observations. It is called the Frequentist Probability.
The Frequentist Probability requires many repetitions of a random experiment to have an accurate probability distribution. In the code example, we only sampled 1000 $(X=x_i, Y=y_j)$ pairs (`xs` and `ys`), which is a small sample size.
If we increase the sample size, we can see the marginal probabilities will get closer to the ideal values. However, it is hard to show the exact result of $P(X, Y) = P(X) \times P(Y)$ in code even with a very large number of trials.

Instead, since we know `xs` and `ys` are generated from two
independent processes, we can set $P(X=x_i)=0.25$ and $P(Y=y_j)=0.5$ manually instead. This is a perspective of Bayesian Probability.
In Bayes' Theorem, $P(Y=y_i)$ is the prior probability, which is set by humans.

In other words, based on the human knowledge, we can decide if we want to use the $P(X)$, $P(Y)$ from
counting observations or use the following theorical values:

- Set $P(X)$ to be a uniform distribution with $P(X=x_i)=0.25$
- Set $P(Y)$ to be a uniform distribution with $P(Y=y_j)=0.5$

In general, prior probability (human knowledge) is better for a small dataset because Frequentist Probability requires a large dataset.
However, one clear disadvantage of Bayesian Probability is that based on personal belief, it could be wrong that I assumed `xs` and `ys` come from
two independent processes. A bad prior probability distribution setup is a problem for Bayesian Probability.

## Bayes' theorem

Recall the `product rule` $P(X=x_i,Y=y_j)=P(Y=y_j|X=x_i)P(X=x_i)$, since joint probability distribution is symmetrical
$P(X=x_i,Y=y_j) = P(Y=y_j,X=x_i)$, we can deduce the `Bayes' theorem` like this:

$$
P(Y=y_j|X=x_i)P(X=x_i) = P(X=x_i|Y=y_j)P(Y=y_j)
$$

$$
P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) = \frac{P(X=x_i|Y=y_j)P(Y=y_j)}{P(X=x_i)}
$$

Here,

- $P(Y=y_j|X=x_i)$ describes the probability of finding our target $(Y=y_j)$ given the `Evidence` $(X=x_i)$. It is also called the `Posterior` Probability.
- $P(Y=y_j)$ describes the probability of finding our target $(Y=y_j)$ before knowing the `Evidence` $(X=x_i)$. It is also called the `Prior` Probability.

If the new `Evidence` $(X=x_i)$ is value-adding, we should see `Posterior` $P(Y=y_j|X=x_i)$ deviates from the `Prior` $P(Y=y_j)$. In other words,
the new `Evidence` $(X=x_i)$ can update our degree of belief.

Also:

$$
P(X=x_i|Y=y_j)/P(X=x_i) > 1 \Rightarrow P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) > P(Y=y_j)
$$

This shows the `Evidence` $(X=x_i)$ is for $(Y=y_j)$. Therefore, $P(X=x_i|Y=y_j)/P(X=x_i)$ can be understood as the `Support` of the evidence for our target.

## Likelihood (in model's parameter estimation)

Let's say we have observed a dataset $\bold{d} = \{x_1,x_2...x_N\}$ from the dataset distribution $\bold{D}$. We want to estimate a model's parameter $\bold{w}=\{w_1,w_2...w_N\}$ from all possible parameters $\bold{W}$
that is the best fit to the dataset $\bold{D}=\bold{d}$. The `Likelihood` $L(\bold{W}=\bold{w}|\bold{D}=\bold{d})$ is the measure of how likely one can observe this dataset $\bold{D}=\bold{d}$ given $\bold{W}=\bold{w}$.

Equivalently $L(\bold{W}=\bold{w}|\bold{D}=\bold{d})=P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})$. In most cases, we have a varing $\bold{w}$ and a fixed $\bold{d}$,
therefore the `Likelihood` is a function of model parameter $\bold{w}$. For example, given a training dataset $\bold{d}$ and 2 models $\bold{w}_a$ and $\bold{w}_b$, $\bold{w}_a$ is better if
$P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w}_a) > P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w}_b)$

Also, since $P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})$ is a function of $\bold{w}$ (varying $\bold{w}$) in this setting, it is not a probability distribution.
$P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})$ is a probability distribution only if it is a function of $\bold{d}$ (varying $\bold{d}$).

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

There are $N$ samples $\{x_1,x_2...x_N\}$ in the dataset $\bold{D}=\bold{d}$:

$$
P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w}) = P(x_1,x_2...x_N|\bold{W}=\bold{w})
$$

Assume those samples are independent:

$$
P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w}) = P(x_1|\bold{W}=\bold{w}) \times P(x_2|\bold{W}=\bold{w}) ... P(x_N|\bold{W}=\bold{w})
= \prod_{i=1}^{N} P(x_i|\bold{W}=\bold{w})
$$

To find the best $\bold{W}=\bold{w}$, we going to maximize the `Likelihood`:

$$
\bold{\hat{w}} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}{P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}{\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(x_i|\bold{W}=\bold{w})}
$$

The objective is also equivalent to maximize the `Log-likelihood`:

$$
\bold{\hat{w}} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}{P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\ln  P(x_i|\bold{W}=\bold{w})}
$$

## Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP)

In `MLE`, the `Likelihood` $P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})$ is a function of $\bold{w}$ (varying $\bold{w}$) in this setting, it is not a probability distribution.
To have a function of $\bold{w}$ that is a probability distribution given $\bold{D}=\bold{d}$, we need to use the Bayes' theorem to find the
`Posterior` probability of the model parameter $\bold{w}$ is true.

$$
P(\bold{W}=\bold{w}∣\bold{D}=\bold{d}) = \frac{P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})P(\bold{W}=\bold{w})}{P(\bold{D}=\bold{d})}
$$

Since $P(\bold{D}=\bold{d})$ is positive, `MAP` becomes:

$$
\bold{\hat{w}} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}{P(\bold{W}=\bold{w}|\bold{D}=\bold{d})} = \argmax_{\bold{w}\in\bold{W}}{P(\bold{D}=\bold{d}|\bold{W}=\bold{w})P(\bold{W}=\bold{w})}
$$

$P(\bold{W}=\bold{w})$ can be considered as the external knowledge of the parameter. `MAP` is like an external knowledge regularized `MLE`.

For example, the external knowledge can come from an human expert, then under the `MAP` setting, a bad model parameter ${\bold{w}_{bad}}$ can be avoided by providing a low $P(\bold{W}=\bold{w}_{bad})$.
An example of bad parameters can be: A model that relies heavily on the gender information for predicting credit default.
