## Counting Integers in Ranges

$[a, b]$: the number of integers is $b - a + 1$.

- $[1, 10]$: From 1 to 10 inclusive, there are 10 integers.
- $[0, 10]$: From 0 to 10 inclusive, there are 11 integers.
- $[20, 79]$: From 20 to 79 inclusive, there are 60 integers.

$[a, b)$: the number of integers is $b - a$.

- $[0, 10)$: From 0 to 10 exclusive, there are 10 integers.
- $[20, 79)$: From 20 to 79 exclusive, there are 59 integers.

**Need to write it down to remember it and avoid the off-by-one error.**

## Rule of Sum

If there are $n$ ways to do something and $m$ ways to do another, then there are $n + m$ ways to do **either** one thing or the other.

- If I can only buy a shirt or a pair of pants, and there are 3 ways to choose a shirt and 2 ways to choose a pair of pants, then there are $3 + 2 = 5$ ways to choose either a shirt or a pair of pants.

### Intermediate Examples

**Example 1**

How many outcomes of throwing 6 indistinguishable coins? (Assume HHHHHT and THHHHH are the same)

Method 1: List all possible outcomes.

- There can be 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, 5 heads or 6 heads.
- There are 7 outcomes in total.

Method 2: Let's Head be 1 and Tail be 0.

- The largest sum of 6 coins is 6 (HHHHHH).
- The smallest sum of 6 coins is 0 (TTTTTT).
- There are 7 possible integers between 0 and 6 inclusive.

**Example 2**

How many unique sums from throwing 6 dice?

- The largest sum of 6 dice is 36 (666666).
- The smallest sum of 6 dice is 6 (111111).
- There are 31 possible integers between 6 and 36 inclusive.

## Rule of Product

If there are $n$ ways to do something and $m$ ways to do another, then there are $n \times m$ ways to do **both** things.

- If there are 3 ways to choose a shirt and 2 ways to choose a pair of pants, then there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ ways to choose a shirt and a pair of pants.
- If there are 3 colors, 2 sizes and 5 variants, then there are $3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30$ ways to choose a shirt.

### Intermediate Examples

**Example 1**

We can take either buses or trains to travel between two cities.
There are 2 trains and 3 buses between city A and B and 4 trains and 5 buses between city B and C.
How many ways are there to travel from city A to C?

- There are $2 + 3 = 5$ ways from A to B. (Sum: We only take **either** 1 train or 1 bus from A to B)
- There are $4 + 5 = 9$ ways from B to C. (Sum: We only take **either** 1 train or 1 bus from B to C)
- There are $5 \times 9 = 45$ ways from A to C. (Product: We need to travel between **both** A to B and B to C)

**Example 2**

How many ways to place 6 people in 3 seats?

- First seat: 6 ways to choose a person. (Sum: We only take **either** 1 person from 6 people)
- Second seat: 5 ways to choose a person. (Sum: We only take **either** 1 person from 5 people)
- Third seat: 4 ways to choose a person. (Sum: We only take **either** 1 person from 4 people)
- Total: $6 \times 5 \times 4 = 120$ ways. (Product: We need to fill **all** 3 seats)
- This also is the permutation of taking 3 people from 6 people: $P_3^6 = 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 120$.

## Permutations

A Permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of $n$ objects is $n!$.

- There are n positions to fill and n objects to choose.
- The first position can be filled with the $(n)$ objects.
- The second position can be filled with the remaining $(n - 1)$ objects.
- ...
- The last position can be filled with the remaining $1$ object.
- Total there are $n!$ ways: $n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 1$

**Example 1**

How many ways to place 4 men and 4 women at a circular table so that no two women are adjacent?

- No two women are adjacent -> men can only be placed between two women.
- There are 3 gaps between 4 women -> there are $3!$ ways to place 4 men.
- There number of permutations of placing 4 women is $4!$.
- Total there are $3! \times 4! = 144$ ways.

**Example 2**

How many 5-digit numbers can be formed from ${0, 2, 4, 6, 8}$?

- The total number of permutations is $5! = 120$.
- However, $4!$ permutations start with 0.
- Total there are $5! - 4! = 96$ ways.

### Perumutations of a Subset of Distinct Objects

The number of permutations of $k$ objects chosen from $n$ distinct objects is $P_k^n = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$.

**Example 1**

How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from 10 digits ranging from [0, 9]?

Method 1:

- The total number of permutations is $P_3^{10} = \frac{10!}{(10 - 3)!} = \frac{10!}{7!} = 720$.
- But there are $P_2^{9} = \frac{9!}{(9 - 2)!} = \frac{9!}{7!} = 72$ permutations starting with 0.
  (The first digit is fixed to 0, and the remaining 2 digits can be chosen from 9 digits.)
- There are $720 - 72 = 648$ ways.

Method 2:

- The first digit can be chosen from 9 digits (1 to 9).
- The second digit can be chosen from 9 digits [0, 9], excluding the first digit.
- The third digit can be chosen from 8 digits [0, 9], excluding the first and second digits.
- Total there are $9 \times 9 \times 8 = 648$ ways.

**Example 2**

How many 4-letter passwords can be formed from 26 uppercase letters, 26 lowercase letters, and 10 digits?

- The total number of permutations is $P_4^{62} = \frac{62!}{(62 - 4)!} = \frac{62!}{58!} = 13388280$.
